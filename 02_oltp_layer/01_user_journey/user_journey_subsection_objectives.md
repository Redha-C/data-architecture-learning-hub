In this sub section, ***01_user_journey***, the purpose is to explain why these different databases have been chosen for the backend of the website.

In this subsection, there are 4 subfolders:

1. API Gateway
2. Product Catalog
3. Search 
4. Cart
5. Checkout
    - 5.1. Orders
        - 5.1.1. Shipping
    - 5.2. Payment
    - 5.3. Inventory

In each subfolder, we'll explain why this architecture is necessary.
