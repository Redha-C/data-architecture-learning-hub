# Business context - An E-Commerce website 

## 1. Company overview
**Sportify** is an international e-commerce company specialising in sports equipment, apparel, and accessories. 

The company operates entirely online, offering: 
- Footwear for running, hiking, and training
- Sports apparel
- Equipment for fitness, cycling, and team sports
- Accessories like water bottles, GPS watches, and backpacks

## 2. Business model
- B2C (Business-to-Consumer): Direct online sales through our own website and mobile app.
- Product sourcing: Mix of in-house brands (higher margins) and well-known sports brands.
- Sales channels:
    1. Website — primary sales channel
    2. Mobile app — increasing share of purchases
    3. Social commerce — integrated with Instagram and TikTok shopping

## 2. Data-Driven Ambitions
Sportify sees data as a strategic asset to:
- Understand customer behavior: Identify browsing → cart → purchase patterns.
- Optimize marketing spend: Attribute sales to campaigns and channels.
- Enhance user experience: Recommend products in real-time.
- Support AI algorithms: Predict next purchase, churn risk, and demand trends.

To achieve this, the company must connect **operational systems** (OLTP) with an **analytical data platform** (OLAP) capable of:

- Handling both real-time and batch data flows.
- Providing a **single source of truth** for all business metrics.
- Supporting analytics and data science experimentation.

With this repository, we'll understand how to transition from OLTP to OLAP systems to build a healthy, well-governed data platform to maximise correct decision-making throughout the company.
